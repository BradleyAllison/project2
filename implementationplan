Implementation Plan
Write a list of things you have to do, would like to do or think you might do. One task per line.
If you are not sure about a task write it with a query (?) after it. 
There is no need to make the list comprehensive because you can keep adding to it as you go along.
Donâ€™t make any additional markings to indicate category or priority. 
There are no rules about how you write the task - just as long as you can understand what you meant when you come back to it.
Tasks can be as large or as small as you like.
When you have finished writing your initial list, read it through quickly once to remind yourself of what is on it and where.
